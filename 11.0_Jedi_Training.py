# 1. Write code that defines a class named Animal:
 #     * Add a constructor for the Animal class that prints 'An animal has been born.'
 #     * Add an attribute for the animal name.
 #     * Add an eat() method for Animal that prints 'Munch munch.'
 #     * Add a make_noise() method for Animal that prints 'Grrr says [animal name].'

class Animal():
    def __init__(self,name):
        self.name = name
        print("An animal has been born.")
    def eat(self):
        print("Munch munch.")
    def make_noise(self):
        print("Grrr says", self.name)

 # 2. Write code that defines a class named Cat:
 #     * Make Animal the parent.
 #     * Add a constructor for Cat that prints 'A cat has been born.'
 #     * Modify the constructor so it calls the parent constructor as well.
 #     * Add a make_noise() method for Cat that prints 'Meow says [animal name].'

class Cat(Animal):
    def __init__(self,name):
        super().__init__(name)
        print("An cat has been born.")
    def make_noise(self):
        print("Meow says", self.name)

 # 3. Write code that defines a class named Dog:
 #
 #     * Make Animal the parent.
 #     * Add a constructor for Dog that prints 'A dog has been born.'
 #     * Modify the constructor so it calls the parent constructor as well.
 #     * Add a make_noise() method for Dog that prints 'Bark says [animal name].'

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self,name):
        super().__init__(name)
        print("An dog has been born.")
    def make_noise(self):
        print("Bark says", self.name)

def myprogram():
    cat=Cat("Felix")
    cat.eat()
    cat.make_noise()

    dog1=Dog("Rover")
    dog1.eat()
    dog1.make_noise()

    dog2=Dog("Hooch")
    dog2.eat()
    dog2.make_noise()

    thing=Animal("Leviathon")
    thing.eat()
    thing.make_noise()

 # 4. Write a main program with:
 #
 #     * Code that creates a cat, two dogs, and an animal with names.
 #     * Code that calls eat() and make_noise() for each animal.
     
#  OUTPUT:
# An animal has been born.
# A cat has been born.
# Munch munch
# Meow says (cat name) .
# An animal has been born.
# A dog has been born.
# Munch munch
# Bark says (dog name).
# An animal has been born.
# A dog has been born.
# Munch munch
# Bark says (another dog name) .
# An animal has been born.
# Munch munch
# Grrr says (animal name) .
